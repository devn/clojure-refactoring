Clojure Refactoring Mode
------------------------

Provides automated refactoring for clojure code in Emacs/SLIME with
clojure-mode.

Available refactorings
----------------------

Extract-fn - extracts the current expression and replaces it with a
call to it.

Global rename - Replaces all calls to the symbol at point (in the
current project) with the new name.

Thread-last - threads the current expression via `->>`

Thread-first - threads the current expression via `->`

Unthread - unthreads the current expression.

Extract global - defines the current expression as a global var for
this namespace (using `def`).

Extract local - defines the current expression as a local variable for
the current function definition.

Destructure map - Replaces calls to keywords on a particular map with
a destructuring for that map in the args. Only works on top-level defn
forms with one type of arity. Also only works for maps called with
keywords.

Rename - Changes a name just in this sexp.

Easy Installation
---

This mode can be installed as a leiningen plugin:

    lein plugin install joodie/clojure-refactoring 0.6.5-SNAPSHOT

The `clojure-refactoring` Emacs functions will then be available
whenever you run `M-x clojure-jack-in` to start a SLIME session.

If you don't want to install as a leiningen plugin, you can also
declare clojure-refactoring as a dependency in your project.clj,
pom.xml or use some other dependency mechanism. As long as the
clojure-refactoring jar ends up on your class path, `clojure-jack-in`
will make sure the emacs interface is loaded.

If you don't use `clojure-jack-in`, see the section "Customized
Installation" below.

Clojure version issues 
--- 

The master branch of clojure-refactoring (where the releases are
prepared) is currently untestable under clojure 1.3, due to many
dependencies on clojure-contrib 1.2. It probably will break something
if you try to use it on clojure 1.3, so be careful.

Work is under way to get clojure-refactoring testable and working on
both clojure 1.2 and 1.3. If you want to help out with this or just
try it out, check out the `clojure-1.3` branch of the repository:

https://github.com/joodie/clojure-refactoring/tree/clojure-1.3

Usage
---

`clojure-refactoring-prompt` will be bound to `C-c C-f` when you're
running SLIME. Press `C-c C-f` at some point in the code and you will
be prompted to select a refactoring.

Note that global rename will be slow at first, as it has to read the
source files into a cache.

NOTE: Still in alpha, has some breakages. Report any problems via
Github Issues please.

Emacs dependencies
---

clojure-mode (with swank-clojure 1.3.3 or higher), paredit, and thing
at point.

Having ido-mode enabled is recommended when using 
clojure-refactoring-prompt.

In general, this code is tested to work on 
[emacs-24 pretest on OSX] [emacs-osx] with 
[`starter-kit-lisp` version 2] [starter-kit] from [marmalade] [marmalade].

[emacs-osx]: http://emacsformacosx.com/builds
[starter-kit]: https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit
[marmalade]: http://marmalade-repo.org/

Customized Installation
---

If you don't want to use `clojure-jack-in`, you should install the jar
as usual (as a dependency in your project or as a leiningen plugin)
and then extract
`src/clojure_refactoring/payload/clojure-refactoring-mode.el` and put
it on your elisp load-path (for instance, copy to or symlink from
`$HOME/.emacs.d`) and `(require 'clojure-refactoring-mode)` in your
emacs's `init.el`.

Hacking Philosophy
--------------------

 * Wherever possible, have a reverse of each refactoring.
 * Refactoring should be quick
 * Refactoring names should correspond to known refactorings from OO
   (where possible).
 * Write a functional test for each refactoring (takes in a string and
   outputs the correct string).

Known bugs
---
After doing a global rename, refactoring-mode doesn't reload the
namespaces in the right order, so there is sometimes a null pointer
exception after doing this. For now, you can fix this by restarting
swank.

Changes since 0.6.0
---

v0.6.5-SNAPSHOT

  * fix tests and `extract-fn`
  * move cursor to arguments / position for inline docs of
    extracted function.

v0.6.4

  * hook into slime-mode-hook so that the refactoring mode is
    switched on for all clojure-mode buffers already opened when
    clojure-jack-in is executed.
  * keep and re-indent formatting of extracted functions

v0.6.3

  * this code can now be installed as a leiningen plugin and hooks
    into clojure-jack-in with no more configuration required.

v0.6.2 

  * all refactorings are now implemented as interactive elisp 
    functions and take arguments where needed.
  * ido is no longer required
  * renamed clojure-refactoring-ido to clojure-refactoring-prompt
  * clojure-refactoring-prompt allows quick selection (partial 
    completion) of alternatives when run under ido-mode

v0.6.1 

  * bug fix release

v0.6.0

  * licensing updates, parsing fixes, general maintenance
